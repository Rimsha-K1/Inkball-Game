### Overview

Welcome to the Inkball Game, a modern reinvention of Microsoft's classic game, developed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and the Processing library, specifically PApplet. This project harnesses the power of OOP to create a robust, dynamic, and engaging gaming experience.

### Features

**Object-Oriented Design:** Utilises encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to create a modular and maintainable codebase.

**Interactive Gameplay:** Players control an inkball to navigate through various obstacles, leveraging physics-based movements.

**Dynamic Graphics:** Implements Processingâ€™s PApplet to render smooth and responsive graphics.

**Customisable Levels:** Easily extendable to create new levels with varying degrees of difficulty.
